# BlindStick
This is a mini stick made from ultrasonic sensors that were fit onto a Stick in such a way that If a person who is blind / disabled / aged can use the stick to walk. As soon as he walks closer to any object, there is also a buzzer connected which sounds more repeatedly and in more high frequency as the object gets closer too.
